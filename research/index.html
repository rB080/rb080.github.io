            <font size="2">Since the latter part of the second year in college, I have involved myself extensively in
                research activities, initially working as research assistant for researchers in my own University and
                eventually outside. In the initial months of 2021, I started working under <a
                    href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/profile.php?uid=780">Dr. Debangshu Dey</a> on a
                research statement of Glaucoma Detection and Optic Disc and Cup Segmentation from Retinal Fundus Images.
                This project involved two tasks: initially developing a detailed survey of contemporary literature on
                the problem statement, and then eventually, developing an encoder-decoder based convolutional neural
                network architecture to achieve the semantic segmentation of the Optic Disc and Cup regions from Retinal
                Fundus Images, obtained from public dataset repositories. The findings were then submitted to and is
                currently under review in the scientific journal: Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, Elsevier.

        <p align="justify">
            <font size="2">Eventually, I worked under <a href="https://web.iitd.ac.in/~brejesh/">Dr. Brejesh Lall</a>
                of
                Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi on a
                research statement of Rib Suppression from Chest X-Ray Images using CycleGAN like architectures. The
                findings are currently planned to be submitted to the MICCAI, 2023 conference. Thereafter, I also worked
                briefly under <a href="https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/people/prasanta-kumar-ghosh/">Dr. Prasanta Kumar
                    Ghosh</a> of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, on Facial Symmetry
                Assessment in images of human face, from January to April of 2022. The aim of the project was to develop
                a scoring metric that helps plastic surgeons to assess facial symmetry as a real world application. Both
                these Vision based research projects involved extensive use of deep learning tools.

        <p align="justify">
            <font size="2">I joined the research group of <a href="https://donglaiw.github.io/">Dr. Donglai Wei</a> of
                Boston College in January of 2022. Here, I
                have worked initially on developing an annotation tool for neuroscience students in the UMass Boston
                Baby Lab, for annotating videos of children making hand gestures while trying to identify shapes.
                Subsequently, I worked on a deep learning based research statement, which involved the detection of
                these hand gestures from timestamped videos. The project was aimed at assisting neuroscience students
                and eventually psychologists at the UMass Boston Baby Lab. Here I learnt more on handling video data,
                since most of my previous research has been on single images in a biomedical setting.</font>

        <p align="justify">
            <font size="2">During the summer break of 2022, I started working with the research group of <a
                    href="https://josedolz.github.io/">Dr. José Dolz</a>
                of ÉTS, Montreal. I initially started working on a large scale benchmark and survey on model calibration
                methods when subjected to various kinds of corruptions in the input image data. This project, unlike
                most of my previous works, involved a more theoretical understanding of the domain, which made it
                somewhat more pronounced in its difficulty. In the later part, I also helped a PhD student and another
                undergraduate student on a project on Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation. This project involved
                developing a new and improved pipeline based on existing language-vision models in weakly supervised
                segmentation tasks. Both these projects happened to be my first exposure to natural scene images, which
                posed its own diverse set of challenges. The findings of the project on weakly supervised segmentation
                are planned to be submitted to the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV, 2023).

            <font size="2">I have also been part of independent research groups composed of students of my own
                University which has led to a publication in the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging
                (ISBI, 2022). This work involved developing a simple and effective semi-supervised cardiac MRI
                segmentation scheme using a linear interpolation of images to achieve state-of-the-art results.

            <font size="2">As an undergraduate student, my research interests have been extensively directed by the
                projects I have handled till date. This has allowed me to learn the nuances of various domains under
                computer vision. Generally I have been acquainted with image recognition and translation tasks, in semi
                and weakly supervised settings, and also have a fair understanding of video scene understanding and
                optical flow. As a graduate student, I would like to explore more specialized domains, which I haven't
                had the opportunity to do before!
